This project runs in python 3.6, using the packages in their correct version as specified in the requirements.txt file.

To train the NN, adjust the parameters in the file reinforcement_learning_snake.py on line 198, and then run that file.

To see the NN play the game, run snake_main.py, and answer the question in the terminal with 'NN1' or 'NN2'.
You can stop the game by pressing ESC.
